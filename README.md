# Introduction:

A media organization wants to extract topics from stories it has published and categorize them in order to compare similar stories and analyze changes between them.

These articles include presidential speeches, international or national politics, science, health and sports, etc. on various topics.

This project will access articles by most discussed topics and analyze the most significant changes that are occurring, and what percentage of each topic was covered in each article.

In this project, two topic modeling algorithms are explored: LSA and LDA using Bag of words and TF-IDF.

These techniques are applied to the dataset which is a corpus of over 11,000 news articles published by a media organization.
